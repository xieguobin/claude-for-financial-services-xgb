## Data Sources

### Company-Specific

```python
# AkShare MCP
get_financials(ticker, "income", "annual")   → Historical earnings pattern
get_quote(ticker)                            → Current trading status
get_stock_info(ticker)                       → Company basic info

# Web sources for calendar data
# - 巨潮公告搜索: cninfo.com.cn
# - 上交所公告: sse.com.cn
# - 深交所公告: szse.cn
```

### Market-Wide

```python
get_index_data("000001")  # 上证指数 context
get_stock_news(ticker="") # General market news
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Coverage Universe

Identify the stocks and sectors to track. Typical A-share coverage universe:
- 50-200 names
- Organized by sector/industry
- Priority tiers (P1 = must-track, P2 = watchlist)

### Step 2: Build Calendar Entries

**For each catalyst, record:**

```json
{
  "date": "2024-04-25",
  "type": "earnings",
  "subtype": "季报",
  "ticker": "{{TICKER}}",
  "company": "{{COMPANY_NAME}}",
  "importance": "high",
  "notes": "Q1 2024 results; watch 批价 and inventory",
  "status": "confirmed"
}
```

**Catalyst types in JSON:**
- `earnings` — quarterly/semi/annual reports
- `earnings_call` — 业绩说明会
- `regulatory` — 监管政策发布
- `policy` — 宏观政策 (央行, 国务院)
- `corporate` — 公司事件 (分红, 解禁, M&A)
- `macro_data` — 经济数据发布
- `sector_event` — 行业展会/论坛
- `lockup_expiry` — 限售股解禁

### Step 3: Prioritize Catalysts

**Importance levels:**
- **Critical**: Likely to move stock >10% (earnings, M&A, major policy)
- **High**: Likely to move stock 5-10% (regulatory decisions, industry data)
- **Medium**: Watch item, context-setting (dividend, conference participation)
- **Low**: Background noise (routine filings, minor announcements)

### Step 4: Pre-Catalyst Preparation

**1 week before critical catalysts:**
- Pull latest data and consensus
- Prepare scenario analysis
- Draft preliminary positioning note
- Alert stakeholders if high-impact

**1 day before critical catalysts:**
- Final data check
- Confirm release timing (morning vs afternoon)
- Prepare pre-market positioning note
- Set monitoring alerts

### Step 5: Post-Catalyst Update

After catalyst passes:
- Record actual outcome
- Compare vs scenario framework
- Update price target / thesis if material
- Move to "completed" section
- Flag next catalyst in queue

## Calendar Format

## China-Specific Considerations

### Earnings Calendar Patterns

| Season | Months | Key Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Q1 earnings | Late April | 年报 + Q1季报 叠加, 信息密集 |
| H1 earnings | Late August | 中报窗口, 分红预案公布 |
| Q3 earnings | Late October | 三季报, 全年预测调整 |
| Annual earnings | Jan-April | 年报密集发布, 分红方案 |

### Lock-up Expiry (限售股解禁)

- 首发限售股 (IPO lock-up): typically 12 months
- 定增限售股 (private placement): typically 6-18 months
- 股权激励限售股: varies by plan
- High lock-up expiry → potential selling pressure

**Risk assessment:**
- Large percentage of float unlocking (>5%) → high risk
- Concentrated holders (single entity) → higher impact
- Company in downtrend → higher probability of sale

### Regulatory Calendar

**Recurring policy events:**
- 中央经济工作会议 (Central Economic Work Conference): Dec
- 两会 (Two Sessions / NPC & CPPCC): Mar
- 政治局会议 (Politburo meeting): Monthly (economics discussed ~quarterly)
- 国新办发布会 (State Council Info Office presser): Ad-hoc
- 央行货币政策执行报告: Quarterly

### Dividend Calendar

- 股权登记日 (record date): critical for dividend capture
- 除权除息日 (ex-dividend date): price adjusts
- 分红实施公告: typically 2-4 weeks after AGM approval
- 高送转 (high bonus issue): historically market-positive event
